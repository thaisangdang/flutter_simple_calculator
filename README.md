## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By building this project, you will learn:
- **GridView.builder:** How to efficiently render a grid of buttons without writing repetitive code.
- **Algorithms:** Writing helper functions to determine if a button is a number or an operator.
- **External Packages:** Using `math_expressions` to parse strings (e.g., "2 + 2") into actual numeric values.
- **String Manipulation:** Handling backspace functionality and clearing inputs.

## 📱 Features
- **Standard Math:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Editing Tools:** "AC" (All Clear) and "DEL" (Delete last character).
- **Smart Coloring:** Operators are colored differently from numbers automatically based on logic.
- **Responsive Grid:** Buttons resize dynamically to fit the screen.
